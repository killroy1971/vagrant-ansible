Learning Ansible Repository
---
This repoistory contains files used to learn Ansible.
I am using "Ansible for DevOps" by Jeff Geerling.

Setup items:
- Set the environment varraible ANSIBLE_HOSTS=ansible.hosts
- Add all of the ip addresses to the ansible.hosts file with the 
  approprite groups
- This assumes the host machine has Ansible installed.  If you run this
  on a non-Linux or non-OSX machine, you'll have to modify the configuration.
